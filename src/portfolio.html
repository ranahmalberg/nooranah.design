          <p class="font-normal">
            Vocal is a publishing platform that allows writers to monetise their
            posts based on reads and win prizes from being a top entry in
            writing challenges. In 2022, Vocal approached Thinkmill to help grow
            their readership and improve the writer experience after the last
            success of shipping the product to market.
            <br /><br />
            For the wider context of the long-term engagement, this is an
            overview from Thinkmill:<br />

          <h2 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Bottoms up problem-solving</h2>
          <p>
            Since the users were writers, the Vocal team had really thoughtful,
            well-written feedback that creators posted and tagged as 'reviews'.
            I spent about 2 days reading and theming up these posts. We found
            that the main downsides to the platform users shared were either
            about an inefficient story editor experience or how difficult it was
            to grow an readership/audience compared to other publishing
            platforms.
            <br /><br />

            This feedback gave us a good sense of pain-points to validate when
            we talk to a more representative sample of users.
            <br /><br />
          </p>
          <h2 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Research plan</h2>
          <p>
            We decided on a mixed methods approach with a quantitative survey to
            first understand the different thinking styles of users on the
            platform, how they currently use it and their attitude towards
            Vocal.<br /><br />
            Based on the survey results, we recruited participants for remote
            focus groups to cover and capture thoughts across a range of user
            motivations and attitudes.<br /><br />

            This survey → interview approach worked well because our research
            questions were exploratory: Who are reading or posting on the
            platform and why? What does support mean to a writer on Vocal? What
            are the current challenges writers are facing on the platform?
            Responses from the survey laid the groundwork for deeper exploration
            in 1:1s.
            <br /><br />

            Evolution in the users as more professionals join Vocal
          </h2>
          <p>
            TBD. We included a question on the use of assistive technologies
            since our population (writers and readers) is very open.
            <br /><br />

          <h2 class="pt-8 font-semibold">Focus groups</h2>

            From findings to actionable insights
          </h2>
          <p>
            A working hypothesis began to form as we spoke to more creatives.
            Improving the reader experience will likely increase engagement on
            the platform, and inadvertently help writers too as they can grow
            their audience through a more meaningful connection with their
            readers.
            <br /><br />TBD.

              Across 5 years in tech, I've gained experience in various
              disciplines such as product design, design systems and UX/UI. I'm
              fascinated by the intersection of psychology (perception/
              attention/ heuristics) and tech.
